## About ##

It's a simple *well-documentated* ***Codeforces.com API*** wrapper.

## How to use? ##

* Import `cfapi.py`
* Create class `CodeforcesAPI` or `ext_CodeforcesAPI`. The second one is used for some more complicated, custom queries, which was created by me.
* Use `--help` if there are any questions
* There is simple terminal utility named `cf.py`, which can help you to understand the wrapper.

## What is the requirements? ##

You'll need the latest versions of `requests`, `robobrowser` and `tabulate` installed.
